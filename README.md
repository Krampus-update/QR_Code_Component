### What I learned

I was so happy when I learned how to use the onerror property for images! It saved me so much time and hassle when I wanted to share my web project with my friends. Instead of sending them two files (the index.html and the image), I could just send them one file that would load a different image if the original one was not found. This way, they could see how my project looked like with the right size and alignment. It was such a cool trick that made my life easier!

```html
      <img class="qr-code" src="./images/image-qr-code.png" onerror="this.src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/926995351871848500/1085327367037263882/image-qr-code.png'" width="90%" />
```
I was so frustrated with the vertical alignment of the page. I tried everything: changing the margins, padding, display, position, flexbox... Nothing worked. I spent half an hour banging my head against the wall. Then I realized it was something simple: I had a typo in the CSS file. I fixed it and voil√†! The page looked perfect. I felt so relieved and happy. It was such a silly mistake but it taught me a valuable lesson: always check your code for typos!
```css
    body {
      background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
      height: 100vh;
      display: flex;
      align-items: flex-start;
    }
```

### Continued development

One of my goals for the future is to improve my group work skills and learn how to become more practical with programming. I think these are important abilities for finding a job in this field. To achieve this, I plan to take some online courses on collaboration tools and best practices, as well as practice coding on different platforms and projects. I also want to join some communities of programmers who can give me feedback and advice on how to improve my skills and portfolio.
